There is a code for the post https://ireznykov.com/2016/08/08/simple-thread-safe-class/

#Abstract
In this post thread-safe class is considered. It has two properties:
- logical property "State" describes state of the object;
- numeric property "Count" counts how many relative objects including current one has TRUE state.
There are described some cases when it is not thread-safe, and unit tests are listed.
